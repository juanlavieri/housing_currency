Initial Setup
Clone the Repository: If you haven't already, clone the main repository to your local machine. Use the command:

bash
Copy code
git clone [repository URL]
Replace [repository URL] with the URL of your repository.

Navigate to the Repository Directory: Use the command:

bash
Copy code
cd [repository name]
Replace [repository name] with the name of your repository.

Creating Branches
Each of you will create a branch for your respective currency.

Create a New Branch:

For Gold Prices:
bash
Copy code
git checkout -b gold-prices
For Bitcoin:
bash
Copy code
git checkout -b bitcoin-prices
For the U.S. Dollar:
bash
Copy code
git checkout -b dollar-value
The git checkout -b [branch-name] command creates a new branch and switches to it.

Confirm Branch Creation: Use git branch to list all branches and confirm that you're on the correct branch.

Working on Your Branch
Make Changes: Edit, add, and modify files as needed for your part of the project.

Commit Changes:

Stage your changes:
bash
Copy code
git add .
Commit your changes:
bash
Copy code
git commit -m "Descriptive message about the changes"
Push Changes to GitHub:

The first time you push your branch, use:
bash
Copy code
git push --set-upstream origin [branch-name]
For subsequent pushes, just use:
bash
Copy code
git push
Collaborating and Merging
Pull Requests: Once you're done with your changes on your branch, create a pull request on GitHub. This is where team members can review the changes.

Code Review and Merge: After review, if everything looks good, the branch can be merged into the main branch.

Keep Your Branch Updated: Regularly update your branch with any changes from the main branch to avoid conflicts. Use:

bash
Copy code
git pull origin main
Finalizing the Project
Final Merge: Once all individual parts are complete and reviewed, merge each branch into the main branch, one at a time. This is typically done via pull requests on GitHub.

Delete Branches (Optional): After successful merges and completion of the project, you can delete the branches to keep the repository clean.

Remember, clear and frequent communication among team members is crucial in a collaborative project to avoid merge conflicts and redundant work. Good luck with your project!
